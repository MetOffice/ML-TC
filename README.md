This repository contains code for exploring tropical cyclone data using machine learning techniques.  The machine learning frameworks in this repo are prinicpally based in python, in particular **[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)**.  Training data comes from a variety of [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) high resolution models based on the [Unified Model (UM)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model/index).

## Getting Started

Set-up a coda environment for this repository based on the `requirements.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create --file requirements.yml
```

This environment requires ~10GB of disk space.  Then activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda activate ml-tc
```

## Data

Current sources of data used by this repo include:

* [Bangladesh Topical Cyclone Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3600201.) via Zenodo. This data is distributed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), please cite https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00847-5 if used.

To download the data use Curl:
curl -# -o [cyclone].tar https://zenodo.org/api/files/476d7685-0a99-4f35-a32d-f6951e89dfec/tsens.[cyclone].tar.gz

where [cyclone] should be replaced with the capitalised name of the cyclone you want to download. 

The file getbengaldata.sh will download the cyclone data, unzip it, and run the data preparation script on it for the requested format and variables. The raw data will be temporarily stored in a folder called RawData while this runs, and the produced data will be stored in a folder called Data.

Example:

> ./getbengaldata.sh A "fg hur"

This will produce data in format A for the variables fg and hur.

## Generative Adversarial Neural Networks
This project uses Generative Adversarial Neural Networks, or GANs. This is a fairly new type of network, proposed in 2014 by [Goodfellow et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). They proposed an adversarial architecture where two network components, the Generator and the Discriminator, are trained in parallel, competing in a zero sum game.

The Generator aims to produce new datapoints similar to the training dataset, while the Discriminator aims to distinguish the datapoints created by the Generator from the training points.

## Network Architectures

There are currently two GAN architectures, based on [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html). One produces images of size 64 by 64 and the other produces images of size 256 by 256. Their architectures are detailed below.

The specific architecture used for the 64 by 64 GAN can be found [here](64x64Architecture.md) and the architecture of the 256 by 256 GAN can be found [here](256x256Architecture.md).
